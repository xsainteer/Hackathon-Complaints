# GovComplaints

**GovComplaints** is a centralized platform for collecting and analyzing complaints, suggestions, and feedback directed at government agencies and their local branches.

## 🚩 Problem

### Citizens
- Each government agency collects its own complaints (if any), forcing users to search and submit separately on different websites.
- Many people are unaware they can submit complaints electronically.

### Government Agencies
- Repeated complaints about the same issue with no clustering or aggregation.
- Manual and inefficient complaint analysis due to lack of built-in tools.
- Incomplete or vague information submitted by citizens makes it difficult to resolve problems efficiently.

## ✅ Solution

- Centralized web platform to unify feedback channels.
- Unique QR code for each agency branch.
- Built-in analytics dashboard.
- Geolocation and demographic data collection.
- AI-powered semantic complaint analysis using embeddings.

## 🧠 Core Features
